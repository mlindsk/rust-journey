Let’s see how long the journey will be; depends on the kids bedtime and
the relevance for Rust at my work.

# Primer

A lot of the material is from the
[documentaion](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/) which I have
either just run as is or changed to understand.

# Concepts and Reserved Language Keywords

This section serves as my own explanation/interpretation of concepts or
just some explanation that I found on the web which I liked. Concepts
are in bold and reserved language keywords are in `code`.

### TODO:

- Traits
- `impl`
- Borrowing/Ownership
- …

Let's see how long the journey will be; depends on the kids bedtime and the relevance for Rust at my work.

# Primer

A lot of the material is from the [documentaion](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/) which I have either just run as is or changed to understand.

# Concepts and Reserved Language Keywords

This section serves as my own explanation/interpretation of concepts or just some explanation that I found on the web which I liked. Concepts are in bold and reserved language keywords are in `code`.

### Traits

### `impl`

https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/hello/print/print_display.html



```rust
fn is_odd(n: u32) -> bool {
    n % 2 == 1
}
```
